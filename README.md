# TimeSeries-Analytic-Prediction-of-OEE-through-ML
An metric model for predicting the OEE from an industrial process from which it is possible to ensure better understanding of the business and stimulating the search for improvements of the productive efficiency in industries.
Steps involved in the Prediction :
1. Loading the data
2. Checking for stationarity of the time series
3. Plotting ACF and PACF plots for finding lags
4. Setting up p,d,q values for ARIMA model by checking all the possibilites and selecting the efficient ones.
5. Making predictions
6. Making accuracy check and plotting residual graph
7. Visualizing the Predictions.
